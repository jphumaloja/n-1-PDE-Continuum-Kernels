# Stabilization of n+1 PDEs using continuum kernels

The purpose of these MATLAB codes is to reproduce the simulation results from Section V of the paper "Stabilization of a Class of Large-Scale Systems of Linear Hyperbolic PDEs via Continuum Approximation of Exact Backstepping Kernels" by Jukka-Pekka Humaloja and Nikolaos Bekiaris-Liberis. The journal version of the paper can be found [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10919086) and a preprint is available in [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19455).

The mathematical background and the documentation for the codes are briefly desribed in the file "codesdoc.pdf.".

## Requirements

The codes require MATLAB.

## Usage

The simulation results of Section V.A can be reproduced by running the script ExVA.m, and the simulation results of Section V.B can be reproduced by running the script ExVB.m.
